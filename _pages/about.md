My name is Inle Bush. I am a chronic overthinker, I overthought this about page. I have more questions than answers. I present the questions and answers I want you to see in this blog. 

I am an undergraduate who gardens, programs, writes proofs, and dissects flies at Cornell University.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
