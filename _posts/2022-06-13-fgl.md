### Gaikotsu - Ikkyu
> Though we distinguish rain and hail,\\
> Snow and ice,\\
> With the thaw, it all turns into river water.

> Isn’t it pitiful? \\
> The memory of this morning’s friend\\
> Rises as smoke into the evening sky.

### Sand County Almanac - Aldo Leopold
>A March morning is only as drab as he who walks in it without a glance skyward, ear cocked for geese. I once knew an educated lady, banded by Phi Beta Kappa, who told me that she had never heard or seen the geese that twice a year proclaim the revolving seasons to her well-insulated roof. Is education possibly a process of trading awareness for things of lesser worth? The goose who trades his is soon a pile of feathers.
